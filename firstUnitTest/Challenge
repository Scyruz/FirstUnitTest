1.    What is the output of each method in the console?
        setup(): BeforeAll - executes before all test mehtods in this class
        init(): BeforeEach - executes before each test mehtod in this class
        simpleTest(): simple test
        otherSimpleTest(): other simple test
        notImplementedTest(): (nothing)
        tearDown(): AfterEach - executed after each test method
        done(): AfterAll - executed after all test methods
        
2.    What is the difference between the setup and init methods?
        setup is executed even before performing dependency injection for test context,
        while init executes everytime before a method in the class.
        
3.    Give an example of when you can use init and tearDown methods
        If I´m looking for something weird that is happening in an application but I really don´t know what it is,
        this methods would be useful to find where is the strange thing going on.
        
4.    What is @Disabled used for?
        To skip testing a method.
        
5.    What is the difference and pros/cons of using Maven Test and Junit Test options?
        Maven test: It displays the results in the console
          Pros: It gives more details about the methods and hoe the program runs
          Cons: Test cases are not allowed to access test classes or resources from other projects
        
        Junit Test: It shows when all methods are tested and how many seconds each one lasted running
          Pros: It iss useful to know the time taken to process each method in order to compare and improve the program
          Cons: It does not give more information further than if the test could be completed or not.
